Resist (Willpower) Attracts ranged weapons with a maximum damage (including magical augments) equal or less than the spell&rsquo;s Intensity.</p>\n<p>* Bypass Armour:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The spell allows the weapon or trap to ignore a number of Armour Points equal to the spell&rsquo;s Intensity. This spell also works against magical protection, such as Damage Resistance or Shield.</p>\n<p>* Damage Enhancement:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The magic increases the minimum amount of damage that is inflicted during a successful attack, raising it to the value of the spell&rsquo;s Intensity if the dice roll is lower. The spell cannot inflict more damage than the weapon is<br />normally capable of.</p>\n<p>* Damage Resistance:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Damage Resistance protects an (entire) object or person against physical damage. It provides the recipient with a number of Armour Points equal to the spell&rsquo;s Intensity. These do not stack with existing protection (whether worn or natural) so that only the highest value protection works.</p>\n<p>* Haste: &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; Haste augments the Movement Rate of whatever it is cast on, whether a person, creature or object. The spell can affect targets up to a maximum SIZ of three times the Intensity of the spell.</p>\n<p>* Protective Ward:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Protective Ward is an augmenting spell which must be cast in association with one or more other sorcery spells, using the Combine component to meld them together. Its purpose is to form an extended wall to which spells such as Damage Resistance, Spell Resistance or Spirit Resistance can be bound, so that the magic defends an area or volume, rather than individual targets.</p>\n<p>* Transfer Wound&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Resist (Endurance) Transfer Wound allows a sorcerer to transfer physical damage from himself to the target or vice versa. By spending an Action Point and concentrating on his Turn he may move a single wound of damage equal or less than the spell&rsquo;s Intensity between the target and himself.</p>\n<p><br />* Endurance con dificultad mas baja</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Folk Spells</p>\n<p>* Firearrow (1d3)</p>\n<p>* Dullblade</p>\n<p>* Heal</p>\n<p>* Darkness Pow m2</p>","cult information":"","conditionsAndWounds":""},"folder":"JLCRN77iEm7JZkgV","sort":300000,"flags":{},"img":"uploaded-chat-images/Luis.JPG","token":{"flags":{},"name":"Kenzo","displayName":0,"img":"uploaded-chat-images/unknown.png","tint":"","width":1,"height":1,"scale":1,"mirrorX":false,"mirrorY":false,"lockRotation":false,"rotation":0,"vision":true,"dimSight":30,"brightSight":0,"dimLight":0,"brightLight":0,"sightAngle":360,"lightAngle":360,"lightColor":"","lightAlpha":1,"lightAnimation":{"type":"","speed":5,"intensity":5},"actorId":"8GLOrXIa3flRN9fe","actorLink":true,"disposition":1,"displayBars":0,"bar1":{"attribute":""},"bar2":{"attribute":""},"randomImg":false},"items":[{"_id":"1sVZoQhDqeTk2DWA","name":"Athletics","type":"standardSkill","data":{"description":"<p>Athletics covers a range of physical activities, including climbing, jumping, throwing and running.</p>","primaryChar":"str","secondaryChar":"dex","baseVal":{"value":29,"init":0},"trainingVal":"21","miscBonus":"0","totalVal":29,"trained":false,"fumbled":false},"sort":-100000,"flags":{"dynamiceffects":{"equipActive":false,"alwaysActive":false}},"img":"icons/svg/mystery-man.svg","effects":[]},{"_id":"WANbQecAvqP27xBi","name":"Abdomen","type":"hitLocation","data":{"rollRangeStart":7,"rollRangeEnd":9,"baseHp":1,"maxHp":"0","currentHp":6,"maxHpMod":"0","attached":{"yHwPJeXvCR4lrhjp":["Bigrandined Armor","4"]}},"sort":3,"flags":{},"img":"icons/svg/mystery-man.svg","effects":[]},{"_id":"VttFJcytJwP72FpJ","name":"Boating","type":"standardSkill","data":{"description":"<p>The Boating skill covers the operation of small floating craft on rivers, lakes and close inshore.&nbsp;</p>","primaryChar":"str","secondaryChar":"con","baseVal":{"value":22,"init":0},"trainingVal":0,"miscBonus":0,"totalVal":22,"trained":false,"fumbled":false},"sort":-50000,"flags":{},"img":"icons/svg/mystery-man.svg","effects":[]},{"_id":"92BGVBM59PWbhMxv","name":"Chest","type":"hitLocation","data":{"rollRangeStart":10,"rollRangeEnd":12,"baseHp":2,"maxHp":"0","currentHp":7,"maxHpMod":"0"},"sort":4,"flags":{},"img":"icons/svg/mystery-man.svg","effects":[]},{"_id":"tehAaFWMCyEn35MY","name":"Brawn","type":"standardSkill","data":{"description":"<p>Brawn is the efficient application of technique when using raw physical force.
